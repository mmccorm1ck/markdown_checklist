## Markdown Checklist for Wear OS 

## This project is a work in progress

A checklist app for Wear OS devices that pulls the checklist items from a markdown file on the paired phone. This is intended to be used in conjunction with a synced markdown note-taking app such as Obsidian, allowing tasks to be checked off directly on a smartwatch.

The project includes both the Wear OS app, as well as a companion app for android. This is used to sync the checklist data to the watch, as well as edit settings that would be difficult to adjust on a small screen.
